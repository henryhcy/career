Picking back up on the Windows machine. Start with `./bin/bootstrap`, then `./bin/board`.

## Needs Chengyang

- [ ] **Google Scholar URL** — `career-docs/resume.tex` links to bare
  `scholar.google.com` as a placeholder. The CV had it hyperlinked but the PDF text
  extraction lost the target.
- [ ] **Confirm `resume.tex` compiles in Overleaf.** The preamble pulls in
  `fontawesome5`; if it errors, drop it. Also check Overleaf's main document is set
  to `resume.tex` (the default `main.tex` was deleted).
- [ ] **Look at the board.** It was built and API-tested on a Mac but never viewed in
  a browser — there was no screenshot tool. Layout, spacing, and dark mode are
  unverified by eye.

## Unverified

- **First Windows run.** CI now exercises `bin/*` and the board on `windows-latest`
  under Git Bash, so the known platform traps are covered. A real run on Chengyang's
  machine is still the proof.

## Decided, don't relitigate

- **No virtualenv.** The board is Python stdlib only — nothing to isolate — and venvs
  hold absolute paths and platform-specific binaries, so one built on a Mac is inert
  on Windows. CI is what actually de-risks the environment.
- **No symlink** to `career-docs`. Windows needs developer mode for symlinks; a path
  that resolves on one machine and not the other is worse than none. Use
  `../career-docs`.
- **No git submodule.** The repos have independent lifecycles; a submodule would make
  every edit a two-step commit for no benefit.
- **JSON is the source of truth**, `applications.md` is generated. Markdown tables
  break on a pipe character in a note.

## Ideas not started

- **Devcontainer / Codespaces** — the real version of "an environment on GitHub":
  edit from any machine in a browser, Python preinstalled. Worth it only if Chengyang
  wants to work somewhere without a checkout.
- **Pipeline stats over time** — considered for the board and deliberately cut; only
  the daily habit checklist was wanted. Revisit once there's real data to plot.
- **Cover letter drafting from a job description** — the template has structural
  prompts but nothing generates drafts yet.
